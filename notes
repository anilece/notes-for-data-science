e= in or 

a E x = a contains x

x E a = x is an element of x

x E/ a = x not in a

: = such that

c
-  = subset

every set has 2 subset itself and null

a U b = a + b - (a n b)

mutually exclusive == interscetion is null set

all complements are mutually exclusive but not all mutually exclusive are comlpements

p(a|b) ==p(a) given b


independent = p(a)=p(a|b)

dependent= p(a|b) =p(anb)/p(b)

law of total probability
p(veg) = p(a|b)p(A) + p(b|a)p(b)

additive law

p(a U b) = p(a) + p(b) -P(a n b)

multiplication rule
p(a n b) =p(A|b) P(b)

bayes rule


p(a|b) = (p(b|A) p(a)) /p(b)


mean(x) , variance(o-) , standard deviation(s)

types of distribtion

finite number outcome = discrete. (rolling a die)
infinite number = continous 
outcomes equal likely = equiproable
outcome with 2 outcome true or false = bernouli
similar experiment many times = binomial
poission distribution - frequency change

chi squared - starts with zero only positive values
hypothesis testing

easy changing -exponential
logistic - 


discrete -> adding up all probabilities upto the limi
p(Y<=y) =p(Y<y+1)

uniform distribution have no useful information
u(p)
all have equal outcome

bernouli 
bern(p) 1 trial 2 possible outcome
p or 1-p --> 2 probaliblity value
variance =p(1-p)

binomial



statistics --> numerical , categorical

numerical -->quantitative,qualitative
qualitative --> nominal , ordinal
quantitative --> interval ,ratio(true zero point)
pi = interval and ratio

relative frequency = frequency/ total frequency


sd = sqrt of variance square

rel.sd = sd/mean

covariance = sum of (diff of value from mean) / total no of observations -1

core.coef = cov(x,y) /sd(x)sd(y)

normal distribution = mean=median=mode
mode = highest value

standard normal distribution z = (x- mu)/sigma(sd)
std.deviation does not change by adding and subtracting values from all points

central limit theorem

standard error = sigma/sqrt(n)

confidence intervals = pointestimate(mean)-(reliability factor * standard error), pointestimate(mean)+(reliability factor * standard error)
reliability factor = z(alpha)/2
confidence level =95% alpha=5%

finding z of alpha
confidence level = 95%
alpha=0.05
divide alpha by 2
z(0.025) = 1-0.025 =0.975

degress of freedom = no of samples -1

population variance unknown - students t
_
x + -  t        alpha/ 2 .(S/sqrt(n)) 
        n-1,
        
population variance known = normal z

_
x + -  Z         alpha/ 2 .(sigma(sd)/sqrt(n)) 
        n, 

z(95)= 1.96. t(95)=2.2
z(90)=1.645 
z(99)=2.575

ci for 2 mean independent samples , variances unknown
degress of freedom = nx+ny-2

hypothesis testing

formulate hypothesis
find right test
execute test
make a decision

null hypothesis = thing which we dont want to happen(less than equal or greater than equal)

alternative hypothesis = thing which you want or predict or true
(ONLY < OR >)

SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL 
probability of rejectinf the null if it is true
alpha = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1

TYPE 1 error - reject null hypothesis(alpha)
type 2 error - accept a false null hypothesis(1-beta)

power of test(1-beta)
