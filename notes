c= v/p

p= n!

v= n!/(n-p)!

c=n!/(p!(n-p)!
WITH REPETITION
   p
v=n

    (n+p-1)!
c= -------------
     p!(n-1)!

e= in or 

a E x = a contains x

x E a = x is an element of x

x E/ a = x not in a

: = such that

c
-  = subset

every set has 2 subset itself and null

a U b = a + b - (a n b)

mutually exclusive == interscetion is null set

all complements are mutually exclusive but not all mutually exclusive are comlpements

p(a|b) ==p(a) given b


independent = p(a)=p(a|b)

dependent= p(a|b) =p(anb)/p(b)

law of total probability
p(veg) = p(a|b)p(A) + p(b|a)p(b)

additive law

p(a U b) = p(a) + p(b) -P(a n b)

multiplication rule
p(a n b) =p(A|b) P(b)

bayes rule


p(a|b) = (p(b|A) p(a)) /p(b)


mean(x) , variance(o-) , standard deviation(s)

types of distribtion

finite number outcome = discrete. (rolling a die)
infinite number = continous 
outcomes equal likely = equiproable
outcome with 2 outcome true or false = bernouli
similar experiment many times = binomial
poission distribution - frequency change

chi squared - starts with zero only positive values
hypothesis testing

easy changing -exponential
logistic - 


discrete -> adding up all probabilities upto the limi
p(Y<=y) =p(Y<y+1)

uniform distribution have no useful information
u(p)
all have equal outcome

bernouli 
bern(p) 1 trial 2 possible outcome
p or 1-p --> 2 probaliblity value
variance =p(1-p)

binomial



statistics --> numerical , categorical

numerical -->quantitative,qualitative
qualitative --> nominal , ordinal
quantitative --> interval ,ratio(true zero point)
pi = interval and ratio
